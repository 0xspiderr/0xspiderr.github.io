Circuit made using the [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/) circuit simulator.

This is a simple first circuit that gradually increases an LED's brightness when
the switch is held down and it dims the LED when the switch is open.
<br/>
<br/>
Increasing the resistor value will result in the LED taking more time to brighten.

You can increase the simulation speed from the website's interface to view this effect happening faster.
